# A-star-Pathfinding-Visualizer

A python visualization of the A* path finding algorithm. 
# Programming Description:
The purpose of this program is to visualize the process that the A* Pathfinding algorithm uses to determine the shortest path between two nodes. It will start by displaying the title screen and instructions on how to use the program. The user will be presented with a 800x800 grid where they can first change the position of the starting node. Then, the user will be able to customize the ending node and then finally place walls along the grid area. A wall is a node that the algorithm can not consider when determining the shortest path. Finally, the user will confirm their selection and then watch the program try to find the shortest path.

# Features of the Program:
The program features a very in-depth tutorial that explains what a pathfinding algorithm is and how to use the program. Additionally, there is an option to generate random walls for the program to run through. Furthermore, the visualization is very engaging as it animates the process of finding the path and backtracking. Lastly, all the controls are very intuitive; 'Left mouse click' is to generate the starting node, ending node and random walls, 'Right mouse click' is to reset the particular chosen grid, 'C' to clear the grid and 'Spacebar is to determine the shortest path between the start and end node.
